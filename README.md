Ghani li is an app that provides a way for blind and legally blind people who want(s) to follow their passion by offering them a localised list for their song lyrics  and support voiceover text size and voice control

# For:
[@Neilha7](https://github.com/Neilah7) - [@rmalshagri](https://github.com/rmalshagri)



# Challenge statment 

Make an inclusive solution to help people who wants to listen to music


# Solution Concept

A voiceover and text size change for legally 
blind and blind musicians so that they can read the lyrics and sing it 

## Why is it important?

legally blind musicians hope to to continue their music career but apps for blind musicians don't exist  



# How does it works
We used Xcode and sketch to make an app that supports localisation in three languages(arabic, english, french), we made sure that our app supports built in accessibility by apple to make it feel like home


## Design 
blind people can't see right so we bother with good design? <br />
well I have a Fun Fact for A person with total blindness won't be able to see anything. <br />
But a person with low vision may be able to see not only light, but colors and shapes too. <br />
That's why we designed an easy to use interactive interfaces, with colors even the blind can see.
